# **Overview:**
The objective was to train a Resnet18 model (default Resent code imported from [this](https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar/blob/master/models/resnet.py "pytorch-cifar-resnet18") github repositroy has been used to keep the number of parameters fixed) for classifying the objects in the torchvision.CIFAR10 dataset.

Our goal is to achieve 85% accuracy, with no limit on epochs (model reached **%** accuracy, crossed % test accuracy at epoch )
