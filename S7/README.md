# **Overview:**
The objective was to 

No. of Parameters in the model:
Types of convolutions used:

The required files are cloned via Github for running the model. Snippet is available in the S7.ipynb file. Following are the names and descriptions of the files imported:- <br/>
*   model.py : The main model file which contains the Net() class which can be imported while running.
*   layers.py : This file contains custom model layers (Batchnorm, GBM, etc.) which can be used in the model.
*   utilities.py : Functions for loading datasets, making train/test loaders, viewing model summary, etc.
*   regularizeations.py : Functions which can be imported for applying regularizations techniques (L1,L2)
*   train_test_functions.py : Functions which can be called for training and testing the model.
*   visualization.py : Functions for visualization of the images, loss and validations plots.
*   config.py: Parameter presets required for running the various blocks in the main S7.ipynb file.
